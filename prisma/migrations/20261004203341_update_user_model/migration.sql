/*
  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `users` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to drop the column `name` on the `users` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[username]` on the table `users` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - Added the required column `firstName` to the `users` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Added the required column `lastName` to the `users` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Added the required column `username` to the `users` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Changed the type of `id` on the `users` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
